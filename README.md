# LILPROF
**`LILPROF2.8xp` is not stable. `original/LILPROF.8xp` is probably stable.**

This is a TI-83 Plus/TI-84 program that is based on the Little Professor backwards calculator that Texas Instruments made a long time ago. It is made for the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition. It probably also works on the TI-84 CE, but this has not been tested.

`original/LILPROF.8xp` is the original program and is stable. `LILPROF2.8xp` is a new, updated version with a better UI, an infinite mode, and is not stable. This is the one that is currently under development. It is organized like this because I made it before I learned about GitHub.

## Installation

You should use the [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw) software provided by TI to send the program to your calculator.

### How to send .8xp to your calculator using TI Connect CE

1. Connect your calculator to your computer. I've found that it's kind of finicky but just play with it until it works.
2. Go to Program Editor and open the file.
3. Go to Actions > Send to Calculators.
4. Click Send.

## Editing/Contributing

The TI Connect CE software has its own text editor, but it's pretty sparse. I would copy the code from that editor and paste it into `LILPROF2_copy.txt` to edit it with a different text editor, then copy/paste it back when finished. (You can't directly edit .8xp files.) For safety, always assume the .txt file is an outdated version and copy the code from the .8xp file first. Never leave your changes in the .txt file. Or just use the TI Connect CE text editor.

**Please note that hyphens in pasted code will be interpreted as a minus sign by the TI text editor.** See [this wiki page](https://github.com/Schobbish/LILPROF/wiki/Negative-signs) for more information.
